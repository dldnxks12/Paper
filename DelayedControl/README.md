### Delayed MDP problems

---

- `Delay factors` 


        1. Observation 
        2. Action 
        3. Reward


---

- `Delay type` 

        
        1. Constant delay
        2. Random delay

---

- `Approaches`



        * Constant delay 
        1. Just ignore the delay
        2. Reconstruct the MDP from the CDMDP (Augmented method)
        3. Predicting the delayed observation

        * Random delay 
        4. Partial Trajectory Resampling(PTR)
